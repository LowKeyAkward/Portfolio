        <div className="about-content"> I am an up and coming
        developer looking to make his impact in the software
        developing world. As a Boston native, I am exposed to
        many innovative ideas and challenging problems being
        created and solved right from my backyard. My
        background has motivated me to develop my coding
        skills and push the limits of what I can achieve.
        I use my keen observation skills to read beyond what
        is needed, and try to plan ahead to the best of my
        abilities. I am able to work autonomously and enjoy
        collaborating with a team, depending on project scope.
        Nothing brings me greater pleasure than being able to
        solve challenging issues and strive forwards. </div>
